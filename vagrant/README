Creating a Development Environment w/ Vagrant
--------------------------------------------

= Requirements =
* VirtualBox (4.1.x or higher)
* ruby (1.8.7 or higher)
* rubygem: veewee (0.2.1 or higher)
* rubygem: vagrant (<= 0.9.0)

= Introduction =
This document will detail the steps necessary to create a development
environment with VirtualBox and Puppet. The bootstrap will be customized
to your machine/environment (ruby/virtualbox/etc), but the internals
of the test machine will be uniform across developers, allowing for
quick and consistent development

= Build a basebox =
A buildbox must be created. For this, we will use veewee. Veewee is an
application designed to simulate a PXE boot environment, replicating
provisioning tools including kickstart/FAI to programatically build
a bare basebox for usage.

To build the basebox and prepare for import, execute the following
command from the 'vagrant' subdirectory. 

<code>
vagrant basebox build debian-squeeze-i386
vagrant basebox validate debian-squeeze-i386
vagrant basebox export debian-squeeze-i386
vagrant box add debian-squeeze-i386 debian-squeeze-i386.box
</code>

= Testing =
To bootstrap the hubot development environment, type:
<code>
vagrant up hubot_dev
</code>
